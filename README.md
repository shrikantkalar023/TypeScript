# **Learning TypeScript**

This is the repo i created and updated while learning TS. **-Shrikant Kalar**

## Notes

1. To run two cmds in windows powershell: tsc ; node dist/index.js
2. To dynamically assign properties to an object we use 'Index Signatures'.
3. 'Static member' belongs to CLASS, so only 1 instance of it in memory.
4. 'Super' keyword is used in inheriting child class in TS.
5. Add 'Override' keyword in front of method to override in objects and implement the method.
6. Open Closed Principle:- Classes should be open(inherit,extend) for 'extension' & closed for 'modification'.
